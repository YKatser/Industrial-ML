# Public industrial datasets and benchmarks
Here we propose datasets applicable for benchmarking of the following industrial problems:
- Recommendations and Optimisations
- Anomaly detection (faults and failures)
- RUL (remaining usefull life) and TTF (time-to-failure)
- Product quality
- Safety and access control
- Other
